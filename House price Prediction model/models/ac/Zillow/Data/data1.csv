72466837;sale;22206;Arlington;VA;38.842178;-77.090417;For sale by owner;This is an advance listing for the sale of a third-floor condo in the extremely popular Shirlington Village Condominium Building, literally minutes outside DC. The condo will be vacant and ready for purchase by a new owner in December (2018). I am currently deployed with the US military until the end of the year, upon returning in November will be seeking to quickly sell the condo, and hope to identify interested buyers now to help expedite the sale.The unit is an amazing loft-style ~900 sq. ft. condo, with a half-story balcony bedroom, ~15 ft. ceilings, ~10 ft. windows, and a ~4 ft. diameter round window as the centerpiece of the main outward facing wall. The design of the condo is a combination of modern and industrial, with 3 exposed concrete pillars, concrete ceilings, tasteful yet industrial exposed piping/air duct, frosted glass hallway bedroom-facing wall, hardwood floors, granite countertops, and hallway vintage sconces recovered from a 1920s hotel in LA. Further included amenities are: flat screen TV mount, inner-wall cable/power routing for floating TV, halogen pendant kitchen lighting, dimmers on all light switches, washer/dryer, walk-in closet, hallway closet/cupboards, and a large bathroom with a ~4x12 ft. glass enclosed shower. Included in the sale is one indoor parking spot on the end of a row (ie. only one car is next to the spot on only one side). Also, I am the original and only person who has ever lived in the condo, so the unit has been kept in pristine condition.Building amenities include: rooftop pool, gym, conference room, entertainment room, front desk concierge, and front desk drop-off dry cleaning. The building is in the heart of Shirlington Village, directly next to the Harris Teeter grocery store and on the 3-block strip with 20+ restaurants and bars, 10+ stores, Signature Performing Arts Theater, Shirlington Library, AMC movie theater, Hilton Garden Inn, and the Shirlington Metro/Bus station. Directly across the street are multiple parks, including the Shirlington Dog Park, and access to the Four Mile Run Trail, which connects to the interstate W&amp O and Mount Vernon trails, among others. I purchased the condo from a Craigslist ad and conducted the original sale directly with the seller (without any realtor involvement or commissions), so my hope is again to directly sell the condo from the web. If a realtor is involved on your behalf, it will be the buyer's sole responsibility to pay any and all realtor commissions/expenses. Closing, titling, and escrow can be conducted by an inexpensive lawyer of our joint choosing.If you are interested in buying the condo, please email me to schedule a viewing for November and December. As I am directly selling the condo and personally providing viewing, please only respond if you are a serious buyer, possess the requisite down payment funds, and have been pre-approved for any additional financing. All that said, thanks for the interest and I hope to hear from you! Thanks! More;84 days on Zillow;400000.0;900;444.4;533599.0;-530.0

Mark your calendar and meet us at 1700 Clarendon Blvd, # 121. You can?t miss it, near the Courthouse Metro and all the fabulous restaurants and retail in Clarendon and Rosslyn. See you there!Would you like to take a tour before everyone gets here? Let?s stop in the gourmet kitchen first. As the chef of the house, I love being surrounded by the professional appliances including a Wolf gas range/oven and Sub Zero refrigerator. There is room for all the essentials with the European high style cabinetry and have you seen the glass tile backsplash-we love how it sparkles under the ambient lighting- gorgeous! The breakfast bar provides seating for your most favorite friends and family and the opportunity to turn around and be part of the living area. Follow the 5? plank hardwood flooring from the kitchen into the sun drenched living area with soaring floor to ceiling windows and electronic powered blackout shades. The entertaining area extends out from here onto the terrace with a brick privacy wall and stairs to the patio off the master bedroom. What a chic place to stop for your favorite beverage before moving upstairs.Would love to show you the second level and all it has to offer. Before arriving home each evening we use the automated home system through our smart phone to get the temperature and lighting ready for a restful night. The master suite is our sanctuary and includes a modern wall feature, hardwood floors, walk-in closet with custom organization system, private patio that allows the outdoors to bathe our room in natural light and our ensuite master bathroom. I like to call the master bath our HGTV moment with modern dual sink vanity, 2-person walk-in shower with floating glass door and glass tile detail. It might take me a bit longer to get ready as the lighting is just too perfect and makes me feel so gorgeous! The calendar is full with friends and family coming to the DC area and wanting to stay with us in the guest bedroom. There is plenty of room for all your things and a second full bathroom with tub/shower and modern vanity. I don?t normally show people a laundry room with stackable unit, but look at how convenient this is on the upper level. And, we can?t forget this loft space. Currently we have it as a second TV area, but I am still deciding if I should turn into my work from home space or yoga room. With recessed lighting and built-in speakers it is ready to become whatever you might want it to be.We just purchased an electric car, so we installed custom built-in charging stations at our two reserved garage spaces. Even better, the parking spaces are right outside our kitchen door. We were concerned about moving from a single family home to a condo but the hand selected location of these garage spaces allows us to not give up the feeling of a single family home with our condo lifestyle. We couldn?t be happier to have a private climate-controlled storage room in the garage as well. Now I don?t have find a spot for all the holiday decorations or our cycling and outside exercise equipment. Security is important to us, so there are cameras by the outside doors, garage and patio, so we can look via our iPad on what is going on and who is coming to visit us. This smart home has it all!We love taking advantage of our Rosslyn community. It is amazing to be so close to it all. The hardest part is deciding if we want to stay in Arlington or venture across the bridge to Georgetown or the rest of DC. With so much variety of dining and retail available including Trader Joe?s and Whole Foods, we can walk to get our favorite selections. Plus we are just a half mile to the Rosslyn and Courthouse Metro stops, 10 minutes to National Airport and have easy access to Rt. 66/395/495. So, I will leave it up to you, the night is young! More What I Love About The Home The location has been everything for us. We can walk to great restaurants, retail and get our groceries. But, we can also jump on the Metro to get all around the DC area. And the weekends we want to enjoy the great weather, we take a longer walk into Georgetown. Even with all the walkability, we still need to drive sometimes. And, that is easy with our 2 reserved garage spots. And our bikes are secure in our private storage space in the garage. So, you could say we have the best of all worlds!;216 days on Zillow;1350000.0;1950;692.3;1800897.0;-1790.0

192150673;sale;22314;Alexandria;VA;38.808193;-77.045308;Townhouse for sale;The stately brick Alexandrian at 600 Princess Street is sited proudly off Old Town~s historic cobblestone street. Ascend a gracefully curving front staircase with wrought iron handrail to enter through a double front door, illuminated above by an arched transom window. The foyer's soaring ceiling draws the eye upward to the glossy hardwood staircase, as well as offers gracious entry to a well-appointed sitting room with a marble surround gas fireplace, sunny window exposure and handsome columns framing the room. Straight ahead, take a direct path to the main floor half bath or open the door discreetly closeting the elevator. From the sitting room, enter the dining room surrounded by elegant wainscoting. It's tucked neatly between the kitchen -- accessible by French doors -- and the two-level brick courtyard. The dining room looks into the top level, with a pergola that beckons for blooming flowers and trailing vines. On the second level, a romantic fountain promises a soothing backdrop for entertaining or a quiet morning spent with coffee and newspaper. The kitchen is outfitted with every device and storage system a contemporary cook needs. While the gleaming copper range hood is the show-stopping focus of the room, utilitarian tools like a trash compactor, custom cabinets and drawers, wood-paneled Sub-Zero fridge and deep sink will serve daily needs from easy meal prep to sufficient stashing of fresh and perishable pantry goods. Access the garage through the kitchen, or step down a flight of stairs into the finished basement. A bank of windows ensures this subterranean space never goes dark, and the gas fireplace ensconced within a rustic stone wall ensures extra glow on the darkest winter days. This space is idea for casual entertaining, with its fully equipped wet bar. It could also serve a family~s needs for guest quarters (a full bath is just around the corner from the bar) or even a quiet office or fitness space. On the second floor, a master suite haven awaits behind two sets of French doors. One set opens into a well-sized sitting room with a wall of plantation shutter-dressed windows that stands opposite a wall with built-in bookcases. Between the two walls stands the home~s third fireplace, making this space a perfect reading room, office, sanctuary -- or even nursery, given the proximity to the master bedroom. Storage and luxury abound in this carefully planned space. Two custom shelving areas offer four seasons~ closet storage, and a sunken bathroom is a spa-like retreat with its deep whirlpool tub, glass-enclosed shower, expansive double vanity countertop, and private water closet complete with bidet. Vertical linen and toiletries storage completes the space -- and a pastoral fresco above the tub elevates it. On the top floor of the house, two additional bedrooms and a full bath accommodate the household's growing needs. Windows dressed with plantation shutters filter sunlight, and generous closet space (as well as attic access) keep clothes, luggage and other items organized. The street-facing room features built-in shelf, cabinet and desk space to streamline work and storage space. With Old Town's bustling dining and shopping scene mere blocks away, 600 Princess is well-positioned for evenings out. And mornings out are a snap, too, with cafes in quick walking distance and easy access to major roads leading into Washington. Access the Metro system by Old Town's cheerful trolley or bus system. Enjoy a view of the Potomac by strolling a short distance to the waterfront, where the Mt. Vernon trail joins downtown sidewalks and offers the perfect route for a run or to walk the family dog. **WALK THROUGH THE HOME WITH OUR VIRTUAL TOUR IN VIDEO SECTION** More;40 days on Zillow;2150000.0;3760;571.8;2868095.0;-2850.0
